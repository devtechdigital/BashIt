# Bashing through Bash

**A 12-Lesson Journey from Zero to Confident Shell User**

## Why Learn Bash? AI Loves It.

You don't learn Bash to memorize hundreds of commands — you learn it to unlock leverage.

Modern AI assistants are incredibly strong at generating and using Bash commands to automate tasks, inspect systems, move data, transform files, run builds, and glue tools together. But they're only as effective as the person directing them. When you understand how Bash works, even at a practical level, you gain the ability to aim AI precisely at real-world outcomes.

Bash is the universal control layer across servers, containers, CI pipelines, developer machines, and cloud systems. It's the fastest path between an idea and an automated action. With a working knowledge of Bash, you can confidently tell your AI assistant to chain commands, process outputs, fix environments, and build repeatable workflows — instead of treating the terminal like a black box.

You don't need to remember everything. AI can handle syntax.
What matters is that you understand the model of how commands, pipes, files, and processes fit together.

Learn Bash, and you turn AI from a helpful tool into a high-power operator working under your direction.

## Who This Is For

You use a computer every day. You've probably opened a terminal before. Maybe you've copied and pasted a few commands from Stack Overflow. But you've never really *learned* bash — not properly, not from the ground up.

This course fixes that. In 12 lessons of roughly 30 minutes each, you'll go from "what does `ls` do?" to writing real scripts that automate your work and make you genuinely faster.

No prior terminal experience required. Just curiosity and a willingness to type things and see what happens.

## How to Use These Lessons

Each lesson is designed to be completed in a single sitting of about 30 minutes. Every lesson follows the same structure:

- **Concepts** — what you're learning and why it matters
- **Commands & Syntax** — the actual tools, with clear explanations
- **Try It Yourself** — hands-on exercises to cement what you've learned
- **Key Takeaways** — a quick summary before you move on

The most important thing: **type everything out yourself.** Don't copy and paste. The muscle memory matters more than you think.

## What You'll Need

- A terminal application (Terminal on macOS, any terminal emulator on Linux)
- A text editor you're comfortable with (VS Code, nano, vim — anything works)
- About 30 minutes per lesson
- A folder to practice in (we'll set this up in Lesson 01)

## A Note on macOS vs Linux

These lessons work on both macOS and Linux. The vast majority of commands are identical. Where differences exist, they're noted. If you're on Windows, use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to follow along.
